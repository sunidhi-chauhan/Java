## Q1) Write the difference between JRE, JDK and JVM?

## JRE 
JRE stands for Java Runtime Envirnment.its provide an envirnment to execute the java program.
it's internally contains JVM.it is responsible to execute the java program.JRE is only used by those who only want to Runtimejava programs that are end-users of your system.

## JDK
JDK stands for java development kit.JDK internally contains JRE & JVM.
provides the envirnment to develop and execute the java program.
JDK is a kit that includes two things.
- Development tools to provide an envirnment to run your java programs.
- JRE to execute your java program.

## JVM
JVM is stands for java virtual machine.it is a sowtware in the form of interpreter written in 'C' language
through which we can execute our java programs.JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line.


## Q2) Write the difference between JSE, JEE and JME?

## JSE
JSE stands for Java Standard Edition. This is the core java programming platform.it contains all of the libraries and APIs that any java programmer should
learn(java.lang,java.io,java.math etc.) 

## JEE
JEE stands for java Enterprise Edition. which means all concepts related to advance java.This is mainly used by enterprises for business solutions based on
web or network.



## JME
JME stands for java micro Edition using this, you can develop application that run on small
scale devices like mobile phones, smart watch etc.

## Q3) How does java achieve platform independency?

It's because of the JVM.the byte code is generated when you compiler the code. that byte code can run on any
operating system,but the JVM  present in a machine differs for each operating system.And this is how java is considered a plartform-independent
programming language. 

## Q4) What are features of Java and explain them?

- Object Oriented
- Platform Independent.
- simple & eassy to learn.
- Secure because java programs run inside a JVM,we can develop virus-free system, No explicit pointer
- Robust(strong) it uses strong memory managment.java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on JVM.
there are exception handling and type checking mechanism in java. All these points make java robust.
- POrtable
- Multi-threaded.
